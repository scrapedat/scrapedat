# Branch Protection & Repository Safety

This document outlines our approach to keeping the codebase safe while encouraging contributions.

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Rules

### Main/Master Branch
We recommend these protections for the default branch:

**Require pull request reviews:**
- [ ] Require at least 1 approval
- [ ] Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- [ ] Require review from code owners (if applicable)

**Require status checks:**
- [ ] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging

**Additional protections:**
- [ ] Include administrators in restrictions
- [ ] Restrict pushes that create matching branches
- [ ] Allow force pushes (only by maintainers)
- [ ] Allow deletions (only by maintainers)

### Development/Release Branches
For feature branches and releases:

**Recommended protections:**
- [ ] Require pull request reviews
- [ ] Require status checks
- [ ] Require up-to-date branches

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

### For Contributors:
1. **Fork and create feature branches**
2. **Write clear commit messages**
3. **Test your changes thoroughly**
4. **Submit detailed pull requests**
5. **Be patient with review process**

### For Maintainers:
1. **Review code carefully but kindly**
2. **Provide constructive feedback**
3. **Test changes before merging**
4. **Keep communication respectful**
5. **Document decisions**

## üîß Automation & CI/CD

### Recommended GitHub Actions:
- **Testing**: Run automated tests on pull requests
- **Linting**: Check code style and quality
- **Security**: Scan for vulnerabilities
- **Building**: Ensure code compiles successfully

### Status Checks:
- Unit tests pass
- Integration tests pass
- Code coverage meets minimum
- Linting passes
- Security scans pass

## üìä Quality Gates

### Code Review Requirements:
- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Testing**: Are there adequate tests?
- **Documentation**: Is documentation updated?
- **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?
- **Security**: Are there any security concerns?

### Automated Checks:
- **Build Status**: Must pass
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80%
- **Security Scan**: No critical vulnerabilities
- **Code Quality**: Passes linting rules

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### For Security Issues:
1. **Don't commit fixes directly** - Create a private security advisory
2. **Coordinate with maintainers** - Plan the fix and disclosure
3. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure fix doesn't break anything
4. **Communicate clearly** - Keep stakeholders informed

### For Breaking Changes:
1. **Assess impact** - Who will this affect?
2. **Plan migration** - How will users adapt?
3. **Document changes** - Update all relevant docs
4. **Communicate widely** - Give advance notice

## üìû Communication

### Be Direct but Kind:
- **Clear**: Say what you mean
- **Respectful**: Consider others' feelings
- **Helpful**: Focus on solutions
- **Patient**: Allow time for understanding

### Review Comments:
- **Positive first**: Start with what's good
- **Specific**: Point to exact issues
- **Actionable**: Suggest concrete fixes
- **Supportive**: Offer help if needed

## üéØ Goals

Our protections aim to:
- **Maintain quality** - Keep the codebase reliable
- **Encourage contributions** - Make it easy for others to help
- **Prevent mistakes** - Catch issues before they reach production
- **Build community** - Foster positive collaboration
